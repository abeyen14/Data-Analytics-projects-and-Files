The project here is titled "Healthcare Operations Dashboard".
It is a Power BI project that visualizes key metrics in a healthcare facility using real, de-identified patient data.

This dashboard provides a 360° view of healthcare operations — including patient demographics, provider performance, medication trends, disease prevalence, and more. It supports data-driven decision-making for improved clinical and financial outcomes.
